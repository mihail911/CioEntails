Hackathon Project 
----------------------------
Source files for my intern hackathon project hosted at Numenta on 7/30/15. This project aims to use the [Cortical.IO](http://www.cortical.io/) API and semantic NLP tools to tackle the problem of textual entailment.
Note this code is potentially very buggy and certainly sloppily written. Given more time, it would have been drastically restructured and cleaned up. This project is the definitions of hacky-- have pity please.
